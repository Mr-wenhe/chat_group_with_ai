# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `flutter run` — run the app on a connected device/emulator
- `flutter analyze` — lint and static analysis
- `flutter test` — run all tests
- `flutter test test/widget_test.dart` — run a single test file
- `dart run build_runner build` — generate code (Hive adapters, Riverpod providers, JSON serialization)
- `flutter pub get` — install dependencies

## Architecture

**AI Group Chat Simulator** — a Flutter app that simulates group conversations between AI characters backed by multiple LLM providers (DeepSeek, Qwen, Zhipu, Moonshot, Baidu, or custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints).

### Key Data Model

- `ApiConfig` — shared API key/URL/model config (1:many with characters)
- `AICharacter` — persona with system prompt, avatar, reply rate limits
- `ChatGroup` — a group of characters with a theme; messages belong to a group
- `Message` — user or AI messages with mention support
- `GroupMemory` — weekly-summarized topic memory per group, auto-updated after each AI round

### Flow

1. User creates AI characters and groups them into `ChatGroup`s.
2. In `ChatRoomPage`, user sends a message → triggers `_runAiRound` which randomly picks 1-2 eligible AI characters to reply in sequence (max 3 auto rounds).
3. Each reply calls `ChatApiService.sendChatMessage` with the character's `ApiConfig`.
4. After each round, if there are ≥8 messages, a summary is generated and stored as `GroupMemory` (keyed by year_week).
5. Each character has hourly reply limits tracked on the model itself.

### Tech Stack

- **State**: Riverpod (annotation-based, code-generated providers)
- **Storage**: Hive local NoSQL database with type-safe adapters
- **Networking**: Dio for HTTP calls to LLM APIs
- **Serialization**: json_annotation / json_serializable for model JSON

### Code Generation

All `.g.dart` files are generated. After modifying any model class (HiveType/HiveField) or adding Riverpod providers, run:
```
dart run build_runner build
```

### Provider Pattern

All providers live under `lib/features/*/providers/` and are re-exported via `lib/providers/providers.dart`. The only top-level provider is `databaseServiceProvider` wrapping `DatabaseService`.

### Routes

| Route | Page | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `/` | `AICharacterListPage` | Manage AI characters |
| `/groups` | `ChatGroupListPage` | Manage groups |
| `/chat/{groupId}` | `ChatRoomPage` | Active group conversation |
| `/settings` | `SettingsPage` | API configs, data management |

### Important Caveats

- `AICharacter` tracks hourly reply counts via `lastReplyTimestamp` and `hourlyReplyCount` directly on the model — these are mutated in `_isEligibleToReply` without re-saving to DB each time, only the limit check is enforced during a round.
- `ApiConfig` stores `apiKey` in plaintext in Hive; no encryption layer is applied.
- The `custom` provider requires a manual `baseUrl` input; all others have hardcoded base URLs in `ApiProvider`.
